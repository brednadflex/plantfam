## **About the Project**

We are a group of plant lovers and web developers, building this site to connect people and plants.  Users can create an account, be or search a plant sitter/plant advisor, upload photos, chat with other users and post, comment and up vote on the social media app.  PlantFam began as a final project for Le Wagon Bootcamp, Berlin, and will soon enter testing phase with users.
